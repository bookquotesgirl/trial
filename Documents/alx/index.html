<h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>

    <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is the introductory paragraph of my webpage. It serves as a brief overview of the content that will follow.  I'm excited to share some information with you today.  This project demonstrates my basic understanding of HTML structure.</p>

    <h2>Section 2: Main Content</h2>
    <h3>Subsection 2.1:  Key Features</h3>
    <p>This section delves into the key features of my webpage.  I'll highlight some of the elements I've included in this document to demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML tags. The inclusion of headings and paragraphs shows the basic layout of a webpage.  This structure is used to organize content effectively.</p>

    <h3>Subsection 2.2:  Clickable Image</h3>
    <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/gTDZZT8/ALX-Logo-07.png" alt="ALX Logo" width="300"></a>  <!-- Replace with your image URL -->
    <p>This is a clickable image. Clicking it will take you to a new tab. This demonstrates another important element that can improve user engagement and information clarity.</p>

    <h3>Subsection 2.3: Further Details</h3>
